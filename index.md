# Intro

This project meant a lot to me as it was an update for my first-ever programming project. It was interesting to see how I started and where I currently am. The GUI aspect was the most enjoyable because I could design the layout and elements based on my preferences. I find Python easier than Java in terms of syntax, and I will continue to develop more projects using it. Besides the GUI, the biggest changes in this version are the options to visualize the data points in a donut chart and to print a receipt via text file. 

# Reason for Updating

1. **Improve Python skills** - Nothing better than practicing code on a project you want to do! Although the syntax is relatively simple, Python is powerful and ubiquitous in many applications. 
1. **Try out a GUI** - I figured this would be a perfect opportunity to try out a GUI since I mentioned it as a possible improvement in V1.0. 
1. **Assess progress** - This project has helped me realize how far I have come in my coding skills since I began. - Self-reflection is a great way to monitor your growth and goals. I will only continue to improve by revisiting projects like this and updating them.

# Future Improvements

* Better visuals
* "What If" implementation that allows users to see differences in payroll with varying hours, pay, and taxes.
* Option to scan text files and autofill fields which are then calculated
