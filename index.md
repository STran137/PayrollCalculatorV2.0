# Intro

This project meant a lot to me as it was an update for my first every programming project. It was interesting to see how I started off and where I currently am. The GUI aspect was the most enjoyable as fine-tuning every button and event was cool to see. I find Python much easier than Java in terms of syntax and I will continue to develop more projects using it. Besides the GUI, the biggest changes in this version are the options to visualize the data points in a donut graph and to print a receipt via a written text file. 

# Reason for Updating

1. **Improve Python skills** - Nothing better than practicing code on a project you want to do!
1. **Try out a GUI** - It was quite fun, and I enjoyed tinkering around with the different features.
1. **Assess progress** - This project has helped me realize how far I have come in my coding skills since I started. I have improved but I will only keep getting better by reflecting on my past projects and upgrading them.
